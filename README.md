Organizing Your Code on Github
We suggest that you organize your solutions this way:

Use one git repository for all exercises in the JavaScript book. (Remember: don't nest git repositories.)
Create a folder within that repository for each chapter in the book.
Create a separate file for every exercise in the chapter.
